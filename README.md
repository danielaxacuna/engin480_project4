This repo contains our work for Project 4 in ENGIN 480.

It includes Delivery 1, which focuses on simulating Annual Energy Production (AEP) using the PyWake Python library, and Delivery 3, which involves hybrid power plant modeling.

What's Included
These Python scripts were used to simulate and compare different wind farms:

vineyard.py – Simulates the Vineyard Wind site

coastal.py – Runs AEP simulation for the Coastal site

revolution.py – Simulates the Revolution Wind site

neartna.py – Simulates the Neart Na Gaoithe wind farm

hybridpowerplants.py – Used in Delivery 3 to model hybrid power plants using a mix of solar, wind, and battery systems

Each script uses PyWake to calculate how much energy the farm can produce based on turbine layout and wind conditions.
