# engin480_project4
This repo contains our work for Project 4 Delivery 1 in ENGIN 480.  
It includes Delivery 1, which focuses on simulating Annual Energy Production (AEP) using the PyWake , and Delivery 3, which involves hybrid power plant modeling.

## What's Included

These Python scripts were used to simulate and compare different wind farms:

- `vineyard.py` – Simulates the Vineyard Wind site
- `coastal.py` – Runs AEP simulation for the Coastal site
- `Revolution.py` – Simulates the Revolution Wind site
- `NeartNaGaoithe.py` – Simulates the Neart Na Gaoithe wind farm
- `hybridpowerplants.py` – Used in Delivery 3 to model hybrid power plants 

Each script uses PyWake to calculate how much energy the farm can produce, based on turbine layout and wind conditions.
